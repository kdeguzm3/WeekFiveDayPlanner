## Week 5: Day Planner

- - - - 

This week's assignment works this way:

* The header contains today's date

* The JS builds the day planner by representing each business hour as a text block

* The time label for each hour changes depends on the current hour.  Past hours will be red, current hour will be yellow, and future will be green.

* If the user has previously entered an entry into the day, the JS script displays said entry

* If a user makes entries into the hourblocks, clicking the submit DIV will save the entries into localStorage
